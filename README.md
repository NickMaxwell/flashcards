flashcard system in javascript

The code does not have a setup process that would allow setting locations.  

Currently locations are hard coded:

Data files are saved to D:\ and copied (with overwriting) to a "D:\Learning System" directory.  Images used in cards are coded to be in a "D:\Learning System\Images" directory.

Code is run by running the Flashcards.bat file
